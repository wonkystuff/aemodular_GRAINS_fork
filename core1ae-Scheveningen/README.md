This is a modern take on West Coast Synthesis made in The Hague by Kassen Oud (https://www.facebook.com/kassen.oud). 

We use two sine waves, the first we'll call the "master", the second the
"slave". The master just tracks the pitch CV. The slave is some set
interval above the master. In addition the slave is hard-synced to the
master. These two are ring-modulating each other. This is followed by a
wave-folder; a classical "West Coast" style effect which is a bit like a
clip, except once the wave hits the maximum excursion it "folds" back
towards the centre. Of these two effects, the ring-modulator and the
wave-wrapper, the first is more mellow and smooth, while the second tends
to be more up-front. By combining those, and modulating them, we can get a
rich pallet of timbres from a relatively simple module like the Grains.

## Note

This firmware works, but there are still a few things that can be improved. Please play around with it and post your comments on the forum at

# Usage of this Firmware with GRAINS:

__Inputs__

* IN1 / Pot1: Offset of the slave oscillator's pitch, relative to the master's, if controlled via CV the Pot will control the depth of CV control 
* IN2 / Pot2: Controls an internal Wavefolder, if controlled via CV the Pot will control the depth of CV control 
* IN3 / Pot3: Controls the pitch of the oscillator, if controlled via CV the pot will add to the CV pitch

__Outputs__

* OUT:        Audio out of the oscillator

__Caution!__ Use at your own risk  (according to GNU General Public License v2 '12. No Warrenty')

This program in combination with the hardware it is applied to can produce harsh and loud 
frequencies that may be of harm to speakers or your ears! Permanent hearing loss may result 
from exposure to sound at high volumes. Use as low a volume as possible.
