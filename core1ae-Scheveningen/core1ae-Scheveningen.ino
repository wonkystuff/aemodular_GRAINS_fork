/*
	"West Coast Osc" / "Scheveningen"; an oscillator for the Ginko Synthese "Grains" module,
	by Kassen Oud. This is based on the "West Coast" style of synthesis, where
	we build up sounds starting with a simple waveform and adding harmonics, as
	opposed to starting with a harmonically rich sound and filtering that down.
	All synthesis bits written by Kassen Oud, using infrastructure borrowed from
	Peter Knight's work, which was adapted by Jan Willem before I got my hands on
	it.

DESCRIPTION:
	We use two sine waves, the first we'll call the "master", the second the
	"slave". The master just tracks the pitch CV. The slave is some set
	interval above the master. In addition the slave is hard-synced to the
	master. These two are ring-modulating each other. This is followed by a
	wave-folder; a classical "West Coast" style effect which is a bit like a
	clip, except once the wave hits the maximum excursion it "folds" back
	towards the centre. Of these two effects, the ring-modulator and the
	wave-wrapper, the first is more mellow and smooth, while the second tends
	to be more up-front. By combining those, and modulating them, we can get a
	rich pallet of timbres from a relatively simple module like the Grains.

	I tried to comment all of this so people who'd like to can learn from it or
	borrow ideas. However, because we're also trying to do fairly advanced
	stuff on a modest CPU, there is some trickery going on that may be hard to
	understand for people who aren't yet familiar with the intricacies of
	digital integer math and bitwise operations. If that's you then perhaps the
	"PWM-SAW" code would be a better place to start your journey.

MANUAL:
	Knob c / cv-c:
		Offset of the slave oscillator's pitch, relative to the master's.
	Knob b / cv-b:
		Amount of wave-folding.
	Knob d / cv-d: Base Tuning.
		Sets the base pitch.
	Knob a; Pitch Modulation
		This gets added to the value set by Knob d.

CHANGELOG:
	Oct 2 2020; initial release
	Nov 26 2021: Updated for core1.Ã¦
