# GRAINS "Bernoulli Gate"

An alternative Firmware for the AE Modular GRAINS module by tangible waves https://www.tangiblewaves.com

To set up the environment needed to install this firmware, please refer to the AeManual for GRAINS on the AE Modular Wiki: http://wiki.aemodular.com/pmwiki.php/AeManual/GRAINS

When the module receives a gate on input A, it tosses a (virtual) coin. Depending on the outcome
of the coin toss the gate is set to output _OUT_ or _D_

The probablity can be influeced by setting input IN1/Pot1: When IN1/Pot1 is set to the middle position, the chance of heads/tails is 50/50. The more the input is set to the left or to the right, the higher the probablity of either heads or tails as a result of the coin toss.
